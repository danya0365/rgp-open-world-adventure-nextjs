## üìù Notes

- Focus on **Dynamic Tactical Grid Combat** first - it's the core differentiator
- Each battle map has unique grid size and shape (like Dragon Quest Tact)
- Grid sizes vary: 5x5 (small), 7x7 (medium), 9x9 (large), 10x10+ (boss battles)
- Use **mock data** extensively during Phase 2-4
- **Mobile-first** approach for UI
- **Performance** is critical for combat animations
- **Save system** must be rock-solid
- **Multiplayer** is complex - allocate extra time
- Consider **early access** release after Phase 4
- **Community feedback** is essential for balance
